This file documents how AI was used during the development of my enhanced portfolio website for Assignment 2.

## Tools Used & Use Cases
- **ChatGPT**
  - Helped debug JavaScript filter and search logic.
  - Explained how to implement `localStorage` for theme saving.
  - Provided examples of fetching data from the Google Books API with error handling.
  - Suggested form validation using both HTML native validation and JS custom messages.
  - Reviewed CSS layout (grid vs. column).

## Benefits & Challenges

### **Benefits**
- Saved time while testing and debugging large code sections.
- Improved understanding of `fetch`, `.then()`, `.catch()`, and error handling.
- Discovered how to handle empty states and give users better feedback.

### **Challenges**
- Some suggestions contained extra or unused code that I removed.
- Adjusted styles and wording to align with course requirements.
- Needed to test and rewrite certain parts to fit my existing structure.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience working with DOM events and API integration.
- Understood how to validate input fields using both JS and HTML built-in validation.
- Learned to manage accessibility attributes (`aria-live`, `role="status"`).
- Improved ability to organize multiple JS features in a single clean file.

## How I Used AI Responsibly
- I **reviewed every suggestion** and kept only what was necessary.
- I firstly wrote the full code by myself then ask AI for improvement.
- Used AI mainly for debugging, clarification, and improvement.
